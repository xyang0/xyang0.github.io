I am currently a Senior Researcher at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ailab.tencent.com/ailab/en/index) in Bellevue, WA, where I focus on the research of generative AI topics related to Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), and Agent Systems, etc. Prior to the current role, I worked as a Researcher in [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) in Murray Hill, NJ, where my research topics are related to deep learning and video understanding.
